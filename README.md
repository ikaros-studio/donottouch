## Introduction

This demo explores an innovative artistic installation that creatively visualizes global temperature data using graphical visualization and motion capture technologies. By combining video-based posture capturing of nearby individuals with a dynamically rendered 3D model of the planet Earth, this installation offers an interactive and immersive experience. The goal is to transform climate change data into an engaging visual format, making it more accessible and impactful for a wide range of audiences.

## Installation

A demo can be found on https://donottouch.ikaros.studio/. To install the visualization locally on your device, you will need the latest runtime of Node.js and npm / npx installed.

To install all needed packages, run 

`npm i`

## Usage

The project uses vite as a package manager, which also supports running the visualization locally. For this, run `npx vite`. A local host will be provided which contains the visualization.
